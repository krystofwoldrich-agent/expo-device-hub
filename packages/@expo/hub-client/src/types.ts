/**
 * The common device-client interface.
 *
 * Expo Hub mirrors live simulators (serve-sim) and emulators (serve-emu) inside
 * the {@link PhoneFrame}, in place of the static `<img>` placeholder. Both
 * backends speak very different wire protocols — serve-sim streams MJPEG/H.264
 * and takes binary touch packets over its own WebSocket; serve-emu streams
 * H.264 (WebCodecs) and takes JSON gestures over a single WebSocket — so this
 * file defines one shared shape both can implement:
 *
 *   - a **hook** ({@link DeviceClientHook}) that owns the connection and returns
 *     the live {@link DeviceClient} state + controls, and
 *   - a **component** ({@link DeviceScreen}, see `./DeviceScreen.tsx`) that paints
 *     the stream and forwards pointer/gesture input.
 *
 * `useIosDeviceClient` (serve-sim) and `useAndroidDeviceClient` (serve-emu) are
 * the two implementations; `DeviceScreen` renders whichever one is active.
